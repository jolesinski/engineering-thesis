\chapter{Analysis of the depth data}
\label{cha:analysis}

The acquired depth information can be stored in computer memory in two ways. The first is the depth map, which takes the form of a two dimensional array, similarly to the plain gray-scale image. In this case, however, the depth measurement is stored in place of the color intensity. Depth map is the simplest way to represent and store the acquired depth of the scene and it is usually obtained directly from the sensor driver. The main disadvantage of a depth map is its inflexibility. This representation is strictly bound to the camera point of view and thus it is inconvenient in further processing.

The second representation of a scene's depth information is a point cloud. Generally speaking, it is a set of data points in some coordinate system. Typically, the Cartesian system is used and the points are defined by their x, y and z coordinates. Point clouds are derived from depth maps and offer new capabilities, such as viewpoint transformation or cloud concatenation.

 Furthermore, most software libraries provide an interface to interactively manipulate and visualize the point cloud, which is a useful tool when 

This chapter presents the main tools used further in the implementation of the autonomous control mode for the MMS robot.

\section{Basic point cloud processing}
\label{sec:pointclouds}

A frequently used operation during the processing of a point cloud is the affine transformation. Point clouds can be translated, rotated and scaled by multiplying a transformation matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{4x4}$ with data points in homogeneous coordinates $[x,y,z,1]^T$. Basic transformation matrices are presented in the Figure \ref{fig:transformations}. Presented transformations can be further composed by multiplication to produce more complex ones.

Preprocessing. Another useful type of operation is spatial filtering. Probably the most basic filter is the pass-through filter, which reject all points outside a given range along a specified dimension. This procedure allows to focus the analysis process on the region of interest, i.e. the reachable workspace of a manipulator. Apart from limiting the cloud dimensions, the number of data points can be also reduced by downsampling. The voxel grid filter is typically used for this purpose. This filter creates a three dimensional regular grid over the input point cloud data and then, in each voxel, approximates all the present data points with their centroid. Such reduction is particularly useful when large point cloud datasets have to be processed online with limited computing resources. Finally, the filtration process has to cope with numerous measurement errors present in the raw data acquired from the 3D camera. Such measurement noise 
manifests itself in the form of sparse outliers, which corrupt the results of further processing, i.e. the surface normals estimation. The impact of those irregularities can by reduced by applying an outlier removal filter. The simplest form of such filter rejects all the data points which does not have enough neighbours within a specified radius. A more refined version is based on the neighbouring points distance distribution. Firstly, the mean distance from each point to all its neighbours is calculated. Next, based on the assumption that the resulting distribution is Gaussian, all the points whose mean distances lay outside of an interval defined by the global distances mean and their standard deviation are rejected from the dataset. The effects of statistical outlier removal are presented in the Figure 222.

In a given point cloud, a single point by itself does not provide much information about the surface to analyse. Therefore, an essential concept in depth data analysis is the local neighbourhood of a point. For a query point $p_q$ in the point cloud $P$ its neighbourhood is given by:
\begin{equation}
d(p_	q, p_i) \leq r
\end{equation}
where $p_i \in P$ is the neighbouring point, $d$ is the selected metric, typically Euclidean, and $r>0$ is the neighbourhood radius. In practice, approximate methods are used, as direct application would require calculation of distance from the query point $p_q$ to all other points in $P$. The algorithms used for neighbourhood search require a parameter $k$ specifying the maximum number of points in the neighbourhood or parameter $r$, denoting the maximum search radius. Proper determination of those parameters is crucial in further analysis. Too small values will not provide enough information about the surface. Too large, on the other hand, will average the surface and skip small details.



Many of the algorithms used further during the analysis of a point cloud base on the notion of a surface normal, known from the 3D geometry. These vectors are also widely used for shading in 3D computer graphics and a variety of methods have already been developed to solve the surface normal estimation problem. One of the simplest uses the least-squares plane fitting to estimate the normal to a plane tangent to the surface, which approximates the desired vector [Rusu]. More specifically, for a given point on the surface, it's $k$-neighbourhood centroid $\bar{p}$ is calculated as:
\begin{equation} 
\bar{p} = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k} p_i 
\end{equation}
The tangent plane is thereafter defined by the centroid $\bar{p}$ and the sought normal vector $\vec{n}$. The latter is computed by minimizing the total (squared?) distance from every k-neighbour $p_i$ to the tangent plane, given by $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k} (p_i - \bar{p})\cdot \vec{n}$. The minimization problem can be solved by utilizing the covariance matrix $C \in \mathbb{R}^{3x3}$, given by:
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{1}{k}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}(p_i - \bar{p})\cdot (p_i - \bar{p})^\intercal
\end{equation}
The covariance matrix $C$ is symmetric, positive semi-definite and possess three real eigenvalues $\lambda_j \geq 0, i = 1,2,3$. The eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue is an approximation of the desired normal vector $\vec{n}$, disregarding the sign. Furthermore, if the viewpoint $v_p$ is known, the normal $\vec{n}$ has to be oriented towards  $v_p$, which means that it has to satisfy the equation:
\begin{equation}
\vec{n}\cdot(v_p-p_i) > 0
\end{equation}

\section{The Random Sample Consensus algorithm}
\label{sec:ransac}
The indoor human environment is abundant of regularly shaped objects that could be described with basic geometrical models, such as planes, spheres or cylinders. The plane model:
\begin{equation}
\theta_1 \cdot x+\theta_2 \cdot y+\theta_3 \cdot z+\theta_4 = 0
\end{equation}
is particularly useful, as the floor, walls or furniture is typically composed of flat surfaces. By knowing which points belong to the surface of a floor, the robot can autonomously navigate and avoid collisions. For this reason, a robust model fitting algorithm is a strongly desired tool in the analysis of the depth data. The point dataset received from the depth camera , however, consists of both points that belong to the model, the inliers, and a lot of other points in the scene, the outliers. Therefore direct usage of classic model fitting algorithms, such as the least squares method, would not provide the desired effect, as they try to fit the model into all the input data points, including outliers. As an alternative, the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, can effectively cope with such problems. In its basic form, the RANSAC algorithm is essentially composed of two, iteratively repeated steps [Dummies,Wiki]:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Firstly, a minimal sample subset is randomly selected from the input dataset. The model parameters are computed using only the selected subset. The cardinality of the subset is the smallest sufficient to determine the model parameters.
\item Secondly, the remaining dataset points are tested to be consistent with the model computed in the sampling step. A data point will be considered as an inlier if it fits the computed model within a defined error threshold. The set of such elements is called a consensus set. If the consensus set contains enough points, the model is reestimated from all selected inliers and evaluated with the error of the inliers relative to the model.
\end{enumerate}
This procedure is then repeated until a termination condition is met, which usually is a fixed number of iterations.
The main advantage of the RANSAC algorithm is the robust estimation. This method is able to fit a model with high accuracy even if the data set contains a significant amount of outliers. On the other hand, the algorithm in its basic form has several disadvantages. There is no upper bound on the time needed to estimate model parameters and by limiting the number of iterations, the obtained solution is may not be optimal. Furthermore, the RANSAC algorithm can only estimate one model per dataset and if multiple models exist, it may fail to estimate any of them. Since the original RANSAC was first published in 1981, it has been widely adapted by the image processing community and many modifications that address the RANSAC limitations has been proposed. A comparative summary of the recent extensions to the RANSAC algorithm can be found for example in [dunno].
